# The Magneto-Viscous Remnant (MVR) Project

This repository contains the source code, numerical models, and statistical analysis for the paper:

**"The Magneto-Viscous Remnant: Anisotropic Stability and the Sudden Silence in Binary Neutron Star Mergers"**
*Submitted to Physical Review Letters (2026)*

## Overview

This project models the stability and multimessenger signature of Supramassive Neutron Stars (SMNS) supported by anisotropic magnetic pressure. It resolves the "static paradox" of previous viscous models by decoupling the stability mechanism from the thermodynamic evolution.

## Repository Structure

The code is organized by the figures generated in the manuscript:

### `src/` (Source Code)
* **`stability_tov.py`** (Generates **Figure 1**):
    * Solves the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations modified with the Bowers-Liang anisotropy term.
    * Demonstrates that a toroidal field of $B \sim 10^{17}$ G extends the maximum stable mass to $2.7 M_{\odot}$.
    
* **`gw_silence.py`** (Generates **Figure 2**):
    * Simulates the gravitational wave strain $h(t)$ for the remnant.
    * Demonstrates the "Sudden Silence" effect where saturated bulk viscosity ($Q \ll 1$) overdamps the f-mode oscillations immediately after merger.

* **`mcmc_analysis.py`** (Generates **Figure 3**):
    * Performs a Bayesian MCMC analysis on X-ray data from GRB 130603B.
    * Fits the magnetic spin-down luminosity model to constrain the external dipole field ($B_{ext} \sim 10^{15}$ G).

### `figures/`
Contains the output images generated by the scripts, exactly as they appear in the paper.
